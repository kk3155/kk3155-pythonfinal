Flask Project 
My app.py file is the main file that is the core of the website. It contains different pages to route to. My index page is my main/home page. 
On the index file, I put a picture of myself, my favorite website, a link to the assignments page, and a link to the classes I have taken.
On these two pages, I described what classes I was taking and what assignments I had to do for this class.
Then, for all of this, I continually updated my git repository. I did have to change the url link of my git repo to get it to work.
I made commits for all the changes I made.
